# Neutrino Key Set
## Introduction
* A basic and clean keyset with simple white-on-black aesthetics, centred key legends, and a utilitarian approach to design 
* Project is still in the interest check and decision phase
* Renders, materials, profile, etc will evolve as time continues
## TODO
* PRIORITY IS TO FIX KLE BLENDER PLUGIN
	* THE ISSUE IS IN CONVERTING THE TEXT TOO A MESH
	* THIS IS AN IRREVERSABLE ACTION
	* RETAINING TEXT WILL ALLOW CORRECTIONS (HOPEFULLY)
* Fix keycap textures in preference of a rougher ABS or PBT
* Render the keyset in different scenes
* Attempt a render with alternate fonts 
* Advance lighting setup
* Produce renders for alternate sizes of legend
* Produce render of full set of keycaps
